# PocketPerc

I created this app to explore the boundaries of enums in SwiftUI! It serves as a companion to my talk on the same topic.

When the recording of the talk is available, I'll link it here ðŸ™‚

## Topic Highlights
- Representing State
    - Representing a collection
    - Increasing coherence
    - Streamlining multiple states
- Enums that conform to View
- (Custom) protocol conformance
- (Custom) raw type (w/associated values)
- Generics

## Audio
While the focus of this project was definitely enums, if you're looking for sample code using AVAudioEngine or AVAudioPlayer, I hope this project will be helpful to you.  
I found Kodeco's [AVAudioEngine tutorial](https://www.kodeco.com/21672160-avaudioengine-tutorial-for-ios-getting-started?page=1#toc-anchor-004) helpful.

## Please note
- You are welcome to use any of this code per the MIT license.
- I own the music.
- This is thoroughly a sample app, but I would use a lot of this code in production. More than I expected to.
- I used Xcode 15 and iOS 17 for this project.
