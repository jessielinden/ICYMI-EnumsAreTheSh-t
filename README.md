I created this app to explore the boundaries of enums in SwiftUI! It serves as a companion to my talk called ICYMI: Enums Are The Sh*t.

When the recording of the talk from SwiftLeeds 2023 is available, I'll link it here ðŸ™‚

## Topic Highlights
- Representing State
    - Representing a collection
    - Increasing coherence
    - Streamlining multiple states
- Enums that conform to View
- (Custom) protocol conformance
- (Custom) raw type (w/associated values)
- Generics

## Audio
While the focus of this project was definitely enums, if you're looking for sample code using AVAudioEngine or AVAudioPlayer, I hope this project will be helpful to you.  
I found Kodeco's [AVAudioEngine tutorial](https://www.kodeco.com/21672160-avaudioengine-tutorial-for-ios-getting-started?page=1#toc-anchor-004) helpful.

## Please note
- You are welcome to use any of this code per the MIT license.
- I own the music.
- This is thoroughly a sample app, but I would ship a lot of this code. More than I expected to. That being said, there are questions and loose ends in it, because it is an exploration. Keep that in mind, and if anything seems questionable, by all means question it! Including to me if you wish.
- I used Xcode 15 and iOS 17 for this project.
